Compare & Conquer is a holographic museum exhibit that we proposed to the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum at Chicago
# Holographic Chamber
This is a part of the compare and conquer exhibhit. We made this holographic chamber possible by creating a base web application that projects the content onto the prism.
